How are you detecting the colors?
    I am detecting the coloors using a function that checks if the r,g,b values of the pixel are within a certain range of the r,g,b of the colors in the image respectively. 
What are you changing them to?
    I tried different changes for the different colors. For the red, I reduced the transparency, and added a pattern overlay. For the bloue, I randomized the hue for each of the pixels, and for yellow, I changed the color such that the viewer can choose the color using sliders. 
What happens if you run your sketch on images of different Mondrian paintings?
    Provided the colors are almost the same as the one's in the current code, it will work for other images.

What song or sound did you pick?
    I picked a christmas carol instrumental song. 
How are you visualizing its samples?
    I visualized it in the form of randomized colored ellipses that draw in rows (the width of the screen) on top of each other. 
    The ellipses are only drawn when the song is playing. 
    I also used the DOM function to change the color of the background.
