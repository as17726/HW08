How are you detecting the colors?
What are you changing them to?
What happens if you run your sketch on images of different Mondrian paintings?

What song or sound did you pick?
    I picked a christmas carol instrumental song. 
How are you visualizing its samples?
    I visualized it in the form of randomized colored ellipses that draw in rows (the width of the screen) on top of each other. 
    The ellipses are only drawn when the song is playing. 
    I also used the DOM function to change the color of the background.
